## Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)

What is SEPA?
The Single Euro Payments Area initiative (or SEPA), covers all of the EU member states, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco.

SEPA, which came into force in 2014, created a single market for euro-denominated retail payments, allowing payment services users to make cashless, euro-denominated payments to payees located anywhere in the area that it covers under the same basic terms and conditions, using just one payment account and a single set of payment instruments.

In simple terms, anyone who holds a payment account with a bank or other payment service provider (PSP) located in the countries covered by the SEPA initiative will, regardless of where in SEPA they are themselves located, be able to send euro-denominated payments to, and receive such payments from, accounts anywhere else in SEPA.


## Payment Services Directive (PSD) :

The Payment Services Directives (PSD) — namely PSD1 (2007) and PSD2 (2015) — are EU regulatory frameworks that govern payment services across the European Economic Area (EEA).
